Hybrid-based combine the methodologies of anomaly-based and signature-based. 
Although signature-based IDS has a low FAR and is very effective at identifying known attacks, it struggles to identify novel or unidentified threats. 
Anomaly-based IDSs, in contrast, have a high FAR but a high detection rate of new and undiscovered assaults. 
Therefore, employing a hybrid approach seeks to balance out each strategyâ€™s strengths and weaknesses to produce greater performance at identifying network intrusions.
