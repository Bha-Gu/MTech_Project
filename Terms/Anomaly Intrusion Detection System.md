AIDS, also called the “behavior-based IDS,” is based on the idea of clearly defining a profile for normal activity.

Any deviation from this normal profile will be considered as an anomaly or abnormal behavior.

The major advantages of AIDS are its ability to detect unknown and new attacks and the customized nature of the normal activity profile for different networks and applications.

However, the main drawback is the high False Alarm Rate as it is difficult to find the boundary between the normal and abnormal profiles for intrusion detection.
