HIDS is deployed on the single information host. 
Its task is to monitor all the activities on this single host and scans for its security policy violations and suspicious activities. 
The main drawback is its deployment on all the hosts that require intrusion protection, which results in extra-processing overhead for each node and ultimately degrades the performance of the IDS.
