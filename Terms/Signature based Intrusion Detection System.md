SIDS, also known as the “misuse intrusion detection” or “knowledge-based intrusion detection,” is based on the idea of defining a signature for attack patterns. 

These signatures are stored in the signature database and the data patterns are matched with these stored signatures for attack detection. 

The advantage includes the high detection efficiency for the known attacks due to the availability of signature for those attacks. 

On the other hand, this method lacks the ability to detect the novel and new attacks due to the absence of signature patterns. 

Also, a huge signature database is maintained and compared with the data packets for possible intrusions, which makes it a resource-consuming approach.
