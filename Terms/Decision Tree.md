DT is one of the basic supervised ML algorithms which is used for both classification and regression of the given dataset by applying the series of decisions (rules). The model has a conventional tree structure with nodes, branches, and leaf. Each node represents an attribute or a feature. The branch represents a decision or a rule while each leaf represents a possible outcome or class label. The DT algorithm automatically selects the best features for building a tree and then perform pruning operation to remove irrelevant branches from the tree to avoid the over-fitting. The most common DT models are CART, C4.5, and ID3. Many advanced learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost are made from multiple decision trees.
