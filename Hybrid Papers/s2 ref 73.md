# Deep learning-based feature extraction and optimizing pattern matching for intrusion detection using finite state machine.
Abbasi et al. presented a hybrid technique based on optimization of pattern matching (OPM) and deep learning-based feature extraction (DLFE) for NIDS. 
Features were extracted using AE, attacks were categorized using SVM, and patterns were matched using Snort rules. 
According to the outcome, the approach performed well in terms of time, throughput, and memory. 
According to the study, the OPM phase was evaluated using packet processing time, throughput, and memory utilization, while the DLFE phase was examined using performance characteristics such as accuracy, precision, and FAR. 
The length of time it takes for a pattern matching engine to process a data packet increases as it gets bigger. 
The Snort pattern matching engine was outperformed by the proposed model in terms of time complexity. 
Other attack kinds were not taken into account by the model, though. 
However, there is not enough data available regarding the outcomes of the DLFE phase. 
Additionally, the study stated that each phase was examined independently, although there is little information on how the various modules interact.
