# Adaptive intrusion detection via GA-GOGMM-based pattern learning with fuzzy rough set-based attribute selection.
In the same vein, using a greedy algorithm-based global optimal Gaussian mixture model (GA-GOGMM-based) and fuzzy rough set-based feature selection (FRS-FS) pattern learning, this suggests an adaptive network intrusion detection (ANID) technique. 
By calculating the information gain ratio (IGR) of each potentially sensitive characteristic based on the FRS theory, FRS-FS determines the best attribute subset. 
GA-GOGM was used to detect the number of clusters to automatically extract the pattern of both normal and attack network connection instances for NIDS based on an incremental learning method. 
The normal and attack pattern libraries were updated at the same time using an online-based updating process that mined popular patterns and eliminated out-of-date ones. 
As a result, the suggested NID model had low false positive and missed reporting rates while achieving high accuracy for known and unknown attacks. 
The model had an overall identification rate of 96.52% when it was tested using NSL-KDD and a self-built Nidsbench-based dataset. 
The modelâ€™s FAR for known attacks was 1.43%, MR of 2.56%, FM of 97.45%, for unknown attacks, a FAR of 0.25%, MR of 15%, and FM of 87.67% was achieved.
