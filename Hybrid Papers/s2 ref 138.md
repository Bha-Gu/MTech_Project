# A Hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection system.
This Proposed a hybrid model that combined misuse and anomaly approach for anomaly detection in networks using Snot and na√Øve Bayes. 
Snort was applied for known attack detection and result in low false positive. 
Feature selection technique was introduced to select 25 significant features, which then serve as an input to the naive Bayes classifier.
Result showed an increased accuracy of 97.5% for the proposed hybrid model, and also its capability to detect new type of attacks. 
With an increased execution speed and decreased processing time.
