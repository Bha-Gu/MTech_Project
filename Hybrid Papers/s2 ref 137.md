# Building an effective intrusion detection system using combined signature and anomaly detection techniques.
Similar to this, a genetic algorithm was employed as a filter strategy for choosing the quantity of features from a given dataset in the hybrid model presented by this. 
With the help of these chosen features, the model was trained using the C4.5 decision tree (J48) as a classifier, and after that, association rule mining was utilized to produce rules for the creation of a normal traffic rule database for the intrusion detection model. 
The findings show that the combined impact of both signature- and anomaly-based systems improves IDS performance. 
KDDCup99, DARPA Lincoln, NSL-KDD, Kyoto, and UGR16 datasets were used to evaluate the model. 
The experimental findings demonstrate that the systems attained a 99.96%, 99.81%, 99.89%, 99.94% and 99.32%, accuracy rate. 
A DR of 99.96%, 99.78%, 99.88%, 99.32%, 99.99%, and FAR of 0.01, 0.23, 0.01, 0.00, 0.2 for KDDCup99, DARPA NSL-KDD, Kyoto 2006+ and UGR16 dataset, respectively, although the model did not consider multiclass classification.
