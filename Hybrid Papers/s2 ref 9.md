# enhancing network intrusion detection systems through deep learning.
This proposed an IDS based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is applied to find complex patterns in attacks and generate similar ones. 
The authors demonstrated that RNNs can be very helpful at generating new types of attacks which can sum up to form a dataset of unseen attacks signatures. 
The method achieved good detection rate for zero-day attacks as it improves the ability of NIDS to detect new attack signature it has never seen before, although with high false positive.
